## About our team, Happetite

Hello, we're Seoul National University's app development club, Happetite. Happetite first came together with the goal of creating an app for people's happiness. We are made up of undergraduate students interested in start-ups and start-up scenes, and we currently move into the startup lounge, Spring Lounge.

Our club is formed as a product unit, and the club consists of one club founder, two planning, two development, and one designer. Although the team leader position was changed twice due to each situation (ex. military…), we were able to complete the launch safely by studying together.

Our app 'mapsee' is the second product released by Happetite and the first app service produced.
